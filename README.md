# Course Scheduling Problem using Genetic Algorithm
- This project presents a solution to the course scheduling problem using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). 

- The course scheduling problem involves efficiently assigning courses to classrooms and timeslots while satisfying various constraints such as room capacity, instructor availability, and avoiding conflicts between courses.

- The Genetic Algorithm is employed to iteratively evolve a population of candidate schedules to find an optimal or near-optimal solution to the problem.
